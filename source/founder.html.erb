            <p>I've been programming computers for over twenty years. Throughout my career, I've focused on using my skills to build better businesses and create a better world.</p>

            <p>I've partnered that focus with a commitment to strengthen my skills in any way that could help my projects succeed. I've always wanted to work with people to accomplish shared goals using technology.</p>

        itsbspoke began in 2010 as my freelance company. I've provided every client with the best that I could deliver personally. At the end of 2013, though, I had the experience of teaching a class of adults looking to begin their own careers in technology. The experience was thoroughly transformative. It was extremely satisfying to help a group of motivated individuals coalesce while on a journey of acquiring new, unfamiliar skills. I finally understood how I could have more positive impact on my community by building my own business, sharing what I've learned with others.

        I'm proud of <a href="/our-model.html">our apprenticeship model</a>, and believe we can use it to deliver great technology at affordable prices. The greatest satisfaction, though, comes from the knowledge that all interests are aligned. Everyone benefits from our good work. In turn, we positively impact our business, technical, and civic communities here in Charlotte and throughout the Carolinas. That's the success at the core of itsbspoke.
        </p><br/>
        <p class="type--large type--light type--semi-bold text-justify">
        I look forward to working with you. Our offerings include <a href="/web.html">homepage</a>, <a href="/app-development.html">application development</a>, and <a href="/consulting.html">consulting</a>. If you don't have a project, please consider joining the community newsletter, now reaching over 1000 people in its third year of operation.
