<p>itsbspoke will collect certain non-personally identifying information about you as you use our sites. We may use this data to better understand our users. We can also publish this data, but the data will be about a large group of users, not individuals.</p>

<p>Like most website operators, itsbspoke collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. itsbspoke's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how itsbspoke's visitors use its website. From time to time, itsbspoke may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>itsbspoke also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. itsbspoke does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.</p>

And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.</p>

<p>Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for optional personal information.

Supplying such personal information is completely optional and is only displayed for the benefit and the convenience of the user.</p>

If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, [COMPANY] may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with [COMPANY] and our products. We primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
