      <h2>What makes us different</h2>
      <p>Many consultancies, via their contract terms, will implicitly ask their clients to bear the full risk of exploring an unknown problem space. Even if they are willing to bear some risk during delivery, they can’t or won’t adapt to the differing needs of the maintenance cycle after launch. At it’s bspoke, we believe a longer, more profitable relationship for both sides comes from working together to understand and mitigate risk at every phase of the software’s life.
